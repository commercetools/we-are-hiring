Our mission is to **disrupt the digital commerce industry**. We are challenging and changing the world of enterprise commerce software. By enabling brands to cross the Commerce Possibilities Chasm (TM), every new communications channel becomes a commerce possibility - from in-car, video content and A/R, voice, and IoT-enabled machines, to the devices of the future that we can only now imagine.

We are a **passionate bunch of coders, marketers and thought leaders, but we are also amateur gourmet cooks, marathon enthusiasts, and stand-up comedians**! At commercetools, our differences really are the fuel of our teamwork. We are bonded by a clear company vision and a well-defined value compass.
